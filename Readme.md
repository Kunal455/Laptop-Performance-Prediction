📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing laptop performance based on hardware specifications such as processor, RAM, storage type, GPU, and price. The goal is to understand how different components impact overall laptop performance and to help users make informed purchasing decisions using data-driven insights.

The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and performance comparison across different laptop categories.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the impact of hardware components on laptop performance

Compare performance across different brands and price ranges

Identify best-performing laptops for specific use cases (gaming, programming, office work, etc.)

Visualize trends and patterns in laptop specifications
